<p>Calcium hydroxylapatite is naturally found with human bones and is a mineral-like compound.This service is best used for moderate-to-severe creases in the face such as nasolabial folds, frown lines, and marionette lines.Calcium hydroxylapatite is biosynthetically produced, which means that no animals or animal products are used. This lowers your risk of an allergic reaction and no skin testing is required. This type of dermal filler is known to produce a very natural result, doesn't migrate and side effects are rare. This dermal filler was first used in dentistry and reconstructive surgery and has a long safety record.</p>

<h3>Hyaluronic acid</h3>

<p>This type of filler has many different brand names such as Captique, Esthélis, Elevess, Hylaform, Juvederm, Perlane, Prevelle, Puragen, and Restylane. This injection can be used to reduce depressions in skin due to scars,injury, or lines. Hyaluronic acid is also very effective in improving the skin's natural contour. Many benefits of this specific filler include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Acne scars</li>
    <li>Frown lines between the eyebrows</li>
    <li>Crow's feet at the corner of your eyes</li>
    <li>Cheek depressions</li>
    <li>Smoker's lines; vertical lines on the mouth</li>
    <li>Worry lines that run across your forehead</li>
    <li>Scars including burns, acne and those caused by wounds</li>
    <li>Redefining lip border</li>
    <li>Marionette lines at the corners of the mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance found in the human body. Hyaluronic acid is found in high concentrations in the fluid surrounding the eyes as well as the soft connective tissues. This is one of the most common and popular types of injectable fillers. Hyaluronic acid is very versitle in the medical field as it is also injected into joints of individuals suffering from arthritis to help eleviate pain and provide extra cushioning.</p>

<h3>Polyalkylimide</h3>

<p>Polyalkylimide is ofter referred to as Aquamid and is a semi-permanent filler used by plastic surgions to assist with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Treat deeper wrinkles</li>
    <li>Plumb thin lips</li>
    <li>Enhance cheekbones and jawline, and to replace facial volume lost due to the natural aging process</li>
    <li>Treat facial wasting due to HIV medications</li>
</ul>

<p>Polyalkylimide is unique as it has little reaction with human tissue. This filler is biocompatible as well as radio transparent which means it will not interfere with x-rays. Shortly after the injection, a very thin layer of collagen will begin to slowly form around the filler over the course of around a month. Eventually, the gel will be completely surrounded. This filler is very stable over time and a large volume can be injected in a single procedure. This product can also be removed if deemed necessary.</p>

<h3>Polylactic acid</h3>

<p>Also known as Sculptra, Polylactic acid is a synthetic dermal filler that is injected in the face. This product reacts with the body of the individual's collagen production. This product is also know as a stimulator. Polylactic acid is a non-toxic and biodegradable substance that has been in use for almost half of a decade! Polylactic acid works extremely well in the lower half of the face and is particularly effective in filling in lines caused from laughter. Unlike other filler, this product does not produce immediate results. Results will appear gradually over a period of a few months. Three monthly treatments focused on re-stimulation of collagen is needed for desired results. An additional 4-6 weeks afterwords will usually yield the final full effect.</p>

<div class="bo_tox">

    <h2>Botox</h2>
    

    <p>Botox injections also known as (Botulinum toxin injections) are a very safe and effective way to improve the appearance of the skin. These injections work by relaxing the muscles in the face which cause wrinkles over time. These injections also assist with aiding in a variety of medical purposes!</p>

<h3>What is botox and is it safe?</h3>

<p>That is a wonderful question that is asked very frequently! Botulinum toxins are neurotoxins that affect nerves and cause muscle weakening.</p>

<h3>What are the different types of Botox?</h3>

<p>A injections 'neurotoxins' are the most common non-invasive aesthetic procedure in the U.S. While they are commonly called “Botox,” there are actually four different FDA-approved neurotoxins that we use in house! These variations of injections include Botox, Dysport, Jeuveau, and Xeomin.</p>



<h4>Dysport:</h4>

<p>The Dysport injection temporarily treats moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows by reducing specific muscle activity. One injection into each of the 5 points between and above the eyebrows temporarily prevents muscle contractions that cause frown lines. The results typically appear 2-3 days after treatment and last for up to 5 months.
</p>

<h4>Jeuveau:</h4>

<p>Jeuveau is a botulinum toxin type A injection used in the treatment of wrinkles. It is also sometimes called the new Botox or “Newtox” for short because it is a new version of the same active ingredient used in original Botox Cosmetic injections. While Jeuveau shares some similarities with Botox, there are key characteristics that make this injection stand apart from other botulinum toxin injections. Jeuveau is a better fit for certain types of facial wrinkles compared to Botox— all at a slightly cheaper price. There are many considerations to make when choosing the right wrinkle treatment, including injectables. Botox was first approved for cosmetic use in 2002. It is used to treat frown lines or glabellar lines (the wrinkles between your eyebrows), along with horizontal forehead lines and crows feet (wrinkles at the corners of your eyes) </p>

<h4>Xeomin:</h4>

<p>If you've done some Botox reconnaissance on your own, you've probably heard of Dysport, another kind of commonly used botulinum toxin. There is, however, a third option that sometimes flies under the injection radar. Like Botox and Dysport, c is a botulinum toxin type A, which is approved to treat wrinkles like the "11" lines between the brows and frown lines. Botox and Xeomin work by the exact same mechanism, which is blocking the signals from nerves to muscles, causing the muscles to relax and wrinkles to smooth out. The "primary difference between the products is that Botox has an accompanying, inactive protein, while Xeomin does not have additives.</p>

<h3>What are the other medical benefits of Botox besides cosmetic?</h3>

<p>Botox can assist with many medical conditions such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Crossed eyes (strabismus)</li>
<li>Excessive muscle contraction (dystonia)</li>
<li>Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)</li>
<li>Eyelid Twitching</li>
<li>Chronic Migraines</li>
<li>Overactive bladder</li>
<li>Pediatric upper limb spasticity</li>
<li>Adult spasticity</li>
<li>Blepharospasm</li>
<li>Cervical dystonia</li>

</ul>
<h3>Can Botox also help reduce pain as well?</h3>

<p>Yes! Many healthcare providers recommend Botox for pain management. Botox blocks nerve signals that control muscle activity, resulting in relaxation and pain relief. Botox injections can be successful in treating:</p>

<ul>
<li>Back pain</li>
<li>Neck pain</li>
<li>Jaw pain</li>
<li>Sciatica pain</li>
<li>Neuropathy (peripheral neuropathy)</li>
<li>Pelvic pain</li>
<li>Chronic myofascial pain (CMP)</li>
<li>Osteoarthritis</li>
<li>Joint pain</li>
</ul>

<h3>We offer Botox treatment to many different areas of intrest!</h3>

<p>There are so many benefits cosmetically and medically for Botulinum toxin injections and each type helps the patient in their own unique way! Depending on the injection being used also determines where and how the injection is administered.</p>

<div class="laser_hair_removal">

    <h2>Laser Hair Removal</h2>
    

    <h3>What exactly is laser hair removal?</h3>

<p>Many women feel uncomfortable with facial hair or hair on other areas of the body. Imagine a laser so fast, affordable and effective that it eliminates shaving, plucking, waxing, and even razor bumps! That is the benefits of laser hair removal! Laser hair removal is one of the most common cosmetic procedures performed in the United States. This laser treatment can remedy the discomfort of razor bumps and ingrown hair that many men experience. The lasers concentrate beams of light directly into the hair follicles, destroying the hair. This is a great solution for people who are not happy with shaving, plucking, or waxing their body or facial hair.</p>

<h3>Is laser hair removal painful?</h3>

<p>The treatment does have a slight prickly or stinging sensation. Most of our clients are able to tolerate the treatment without difficulty. However, since every persons level of sensitivity is different and treatment areas may vary, a topical numbing cream is available for purchase.</p>

<h3>What areas of the body can be treated?</h3>

<p>That is a great question! Laser hair removal can be anywhere on the body! The most commonly treated areas include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Back</li>
    <li>Bikini area</li>
    <li>Buttocks</li>
    <li>Legs</li>
    <li>Face</li>
    <li>Chest</li>
    <li>Underarms</li>
    <li>Arms</li>
    <li>Neck</li>
    <li>Feet</li>
</ul>

<p>Laser hair removal can be used to treat hair on almost every area of the body. Be sure to ask a member of our team which treatment area works best for your goals.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of laser hair removal?</h3>

<p>Lasers are precise instruments that can be adjusted to the exact parameters that will specifically disable the hair follicle. The laser uses a wide beam that treats many hairs at once instead of treating hair-by-hair like electrolysis. Because of this, large areas such as your legs, arms, or back can be treated in a relatively short period of time. You will see results that last far longer than tweezing, waxing, shaving, chemical depilation, or other temporary methods.</p>

<h3>Who Is Not A Candidate For Laser Hair Removal?</h3>

<p>Most adults are great candidates for laser hair removal. Some of the characteristics that we observe during a consultation include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Skin type</li>

<p>Laser hair removal works by targeting melanin in strands of hair. Having darker skin tone than hair used to prevent some people from being good candidates for laser hair removal. With advances in technology, we can treat a wider range of skin tones and types using the latest laser devices.</p>

<li>Hair type and color</li>

<p>Looking again at the targeting of melanin, we can see that darker hair is generally easier to reduce than lighter hair. Coarser hair is also more responsive to laser light. Finer, lighter hair can often be removed with laser treatments, though more sessions may be needed to achieve lasting results.</p>


<li>Personal commitment</li>

<p>For a person to be a good candidate for laser hair removal, they must be willing to commit to their series of treatments. The entire process can take over a year. However, because results occur right away, it should be easy to see the entire treatment plan through to completion.</p>

<li>Pain tolerance</li>

<p>This is not to say that laser hair removal is painful. It isn’t. However, there are sensations during treatment that may feel like zaps of heat or snaps of a rubber band. The short-lived sunburned sensation after treatment also needs to be taken into account when committing to a round of laser hair removal. There are ways to manage the minor discomforts of treatment, and the benefits are far greater than the mild side effects that occur.Laser hair removal is not appropriate for women who are pregnant or nursing. Treatment also may not work on very light or gray hair due to the lack of melanin. People with an active skin infection or dermatologic problem in the desired treatment area will need to postpone treatment until their condition has resolved.</p>

<h2>Fat Reduction</h2>

<h3>What is fat reduction exactly?</h3>

<p>Fat reduction is one of our most popular procedures that we specialize in at Nelson Asthetics! At Nelson Asthetics we offer two different non-invasive treatments to assist with reducing fat in the desired areas.</p>

<h3>Different fat reduction treatments available</h3>

<h4>Cryolipolysis (CoolSculpting®)</h4>

<p>Cryolipolysis is a noninvasive technology that uses extreme cold to dismantle fat cells and help reduce a fat pocket. A paneled or cupped device is placed on top of the skin in the treatment area, where it transmits temperatures that are just low enough to freeze fat cells, essentially destroying them. Because skin, muscle and nerve tissue freeze at a lower temperature than fat, these tissues remain unharmed. CoolSculpting is the brand name of cryolipolysis.</p>

<h4>Injectable Deoxycholic Acid (Kybella®)</h4>

<p>Deoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the body that helps break down fat for digestion. In injectable form, deoxycholic acid can break down fat cells on contact for isolated reduction of a fat pocket. Currently, Kybella (formerly called ATX-101) is the only FDA approved form of injectable deoxycholic acid, and can be used to effectively reduce a double chin.</p>

<h3>Is fat reduction safe?</h3>

<p>The FDA has certified Coolsculpting and other cryolipolysis procedures as safe for use. Multiple reviews have concluded that cryolipolysis is a reliable, safe alternative to procedures like liposuction, with limited side effects. Our fat reduction techniques are safe and very effective! Schedule your free consultation to be one step closer to a happier and healthier you!</p>
